 Thank you for downloading my entry for the NOKIA JAM 2023!
 
 This game is written in Python, thus (if you have Python in installed)
 it can be run using the command:
 
 python corny.py
 
 (Any not-preinstalled dependencies will be installed using PIP)
 
 If you are on Windows you can run the executable Corny.exe
