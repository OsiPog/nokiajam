# Corny

Corny is a simple racing game where you can race to get the best  times. With drifting around the corners or taking clever shortcuts  improve your time to unlock new levels.

This game was made for the NOKIA JAM 2023 and this is why it has only two colours and a very low resolution.

You can find the source code to the game [on GitHub](https://github.com/OsiPog/nokiajam).

Use the itch.io App to run the game securely. 
Alternatively you can find instructions on how to run the game in the ZIP-file:

- On **Linux** you can run **python corny.py** and it will download needed packages and launch the game. 
- On **Windows** you just have to run the **corny.exe** file.
